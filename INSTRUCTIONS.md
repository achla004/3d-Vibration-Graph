# Tasks to be completed

 - Vibration data is being generated by a function called
   `generateVibrationData` written in `generateData.ts` file.  
 - We need to plot this data into a 3D chart as shown in below image 
 - ![enter image description here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Salem-Al-Hashmi/publication/261081620/figure/fig4/AS:681318551654400@1539450409526/waterfall-plot-of-acoustics-data-20-Hz-2kHz.ppm)
 - You can use any charting library for plotting this.
 - Look and feel and color may differ but key points to be covered 
 
	 - Chart should be rendered in 3D 
	 - Tooltip should be displayed for all the series together. Example, when frequency of 100 is selected on x-axis, tooltip should display `series 1: 0.04 ips Series 2: 0.8 ips, Series 3: 0.7 ips, Frequency: 100 Hz`
